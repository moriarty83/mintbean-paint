# DRAW

A Frontend Web-Based Drawing Application
https://draw-mintbean.herokuapp.com/

## Description

Draw is a web based drawing application for desktop built for the MintBean Jr. Web Developer Hackaton held in November of 2021. This simple frontend application offers users the ability to draw on a canvas with a wide range of color and brush strokes as well as a flood fill option.

Instead of offering a backend for storing and sharing images, this application offers users the ability to download their creation to their local computer.

Note: Unfortunately mobile support is not avialable at this time.

### Executing program

Simply visit https://draw-mintbean.herokuapp.com/ with any modern web browser. Functionality with Internet Explorer cannot be guarenteed.
